This has been a great challenge for learning react and I'm learning a ton. That said it is not yet in a finished state.
There is no local persistant data storage method though I believe I will be able to create one using hooks and states, and the edit/add/delete features don't work yet on the tables. 
I have a plan for the missing methods involving bubbling up events through the component states using hooks but I've still got some learning to do.

## How to run

This app is written in native react and can be run with following the following steps
&nbsp; 
```
git clone https://github.com/JayBuckley7/ReactContactList.git
cd ReactContactList
npm start 
```
( I actually dont think this will work yet I've used a couple librarys that I don't know if will come straight through the dependency file or not.
When the core logic works I will make sure this does too.)
I will also be cleaning a lot of the little error messages. and maybe the form validation.
